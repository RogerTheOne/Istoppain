        <h1>Treat Pain with Acupuncture</h1>
        <p>
            Acupuncture is best known for its ability to successfully treat pain. Pain itself isnot a diagnosis, but rather an indication or warning that there is a problemsomewhere in the body. Many times the exact location of pain points to where theproblem is, as in the case of elbow pain above an inflamed tendon. But in othersituations the site of pain may be related to problems far away, as in leg painresulting from a herniated disk pushing on a nerve in the back.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intensity of the pain usually indicates or warns how severe the problem is.Each person has a different pain threshold, but pain levels that increase or do notlessen over time point to something that needs attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the circumstances surrounding the onset of the pain are just as important.Was there an accident or incident? Or did the pain gradually develop over acourse of time or during a certain period of life?
        </p>
        <p>
            The characteristics of pain give important information about what is causing thebody to send this signal. Once noticed, it is important to address the underlyingproblem that forced the body to send a pain message, not just turn down thediscomfort. Otherwise the body will send out other warning signals until the coreproblem is corrected.

        How does acupuncture stop pain?

        <p>
            There are many therapies that attempt to stop pain. Most of them mask the pain while hoping the body is able to heal itself or push the body to heal faster while offering limited pain relief. Acupuncture is an extremely powerful and effective approach to treat pain because it decreases pain levels as it stimulates the bodys healing response. Acupuncture resolves pain by affecting several pain pathways and healing responses at the same time:
        </p>
        <li>raise endorphin levels and diminish the nervous systems pain response </li>
        <li>decrease inflammation and swelling </li>
        <li>relax muscles and stop spasms </li>
        <li>increase circulation to the local area </li>
